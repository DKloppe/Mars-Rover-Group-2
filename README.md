# Mars-Rover-Group-2

## Altitude

Altitude was recorded by the GPS and BARO sensor. The BARO sensor uses a zero altitude position as the initial point, but the altitude from the GPS sensor is relative to sea level.

## Waypoints

The displacement from the expected path was monitored in NTUN.XTrack. 
There was a maximum deviation of 1.95 meters. 
The next maximum deviation was 0.57 meters. 
Both of these errors were preceded by the only right turns conducted during the rover's operation, leading to the hypothesis; if the error is greatest after each right turn, then the rover has an issue turning right.
