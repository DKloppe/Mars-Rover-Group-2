## Altitude

Altitude was recorded by the GPS and BARO sensors. The BARO sensor uses a zero altitude position as the initial point and is also working on the pressure-altitude sensing principle to find the altitude, while the altitude from the GPS sensor is relative to sea level and is pulled from the GPS sensor and mission planner software. When looking

DHT-11 data was only recorded for 301 seconds of the total run

Temperature and Pressure link note pressure is in millibar and needs conversion to pascals look for the 2 pm value (https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services/Edwardsville,%20Il/metric/2023-12-01/2023-12-01#)

## Waypoints

The displacement from the expected path was monitored in NTUN.XTrack. 
There was a maximum deviation of 1.95 meters. 
The next maximum deviation was 0.57 meters. 
Both of these errors were preceded by the only right turns conducted during the rover's operation, leading to the hypothesis; if the error is greatest after each right turn, then the rover has an issue turning right.
